authentication:-
    authentication is refered to user checking .i.e is user already register is he entered right password such kind of login 
    related things comes under authentication.

    main two important factors here are username and password.

    password is very sensetive information ,hence we cannot store it as it is. for security purpose we stores a hashed from of 
    password,
    before hashing password gets salted i.e. some strings are added to it

    passport is library which helps in authentication.
    passport-local helps us to simple usernaem,password registeration,there are other forms also which we can implement to add options like sign up with google ,sign up with facebook.


    passport-local-mongoose: this library helps us to do authentication with working with mongoDB database.
                            this library inheritly adds username and password. and also it automatically adds salt value and hashing function on it. 

autherization:-
    Autherization is having access for doing something. like who can delete the particular listing or review,who can edit given listing.
    Before doing autherization we need to add one more feild to listing schema which known as owner of  the listing,which holds the id of user.
